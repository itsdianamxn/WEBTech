        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This documentation provides a detailed overview of the "Child Manager", a web-based application designed to help parents and guardians manage and track the development and daily activities of their children. This document aims to assist developers, project reviewers, and users in understanding the functionalities and architecture of the application.
        </p>

        <h3 id="purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The "Child Manager" application provides a centralized platform for managing children's health, education, and daily activities. It allows users to register profiles for their children, track developmental milestones, manage educational and medical records, and integrate multimedia resources.
        </p>

        <h3 id="audience">1.2 Intended Audience</h3>
        <p>
            This document is intended for software developers involved in maintaining and enhancing the application, educational and health professionals seeking to understand the application's capabilities, and end-users looking for instructions on how to navigate and use the features of the application.
        </p>

        <h3 id="product-scope">1.3 Product Scope</h3>
        <p>
            The product serves as a digital assistant for parents managing the complexities associated with child upbringing, from infancy through to adolescence. It incorporates a range of tools including a calendar for tracking sleep and feeding, a multimedia gallery for memories, medical and developmental records, and the possibility to track a child's relationships.

        <h3 id="functs">2.1 Functionalities of the Product</h3>
        <p>
            The product allows users to register and login on the website, then register children that are in 
            their care. Once a child has been registered, the user has access to a multitude of functionalities.
            They can save photos and videos related to the child on the website and can also share them online to friends
            and familly. Also, there is a "timeline" function, that a user can personally build by selecting the 
            precise photos, videos and moments that are worthy or remembering, and the product will create
            a timeline of these photos in chronological order. The user will receive notifications to remind him of 
            any habbits of the child, such as the times when it has to sleep or take specific medication.
        <br>
            In case that anything happens to the product, the user can export their data using the "Export" function 
            and have it saved in a JSON format. They can later import that same data once the website is back up and running again.
